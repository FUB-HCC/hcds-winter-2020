## A1 - Warm up

Luckily, I already had all tools installed. :)

### Wikipedia Edits

I choose the wiki article about the us election 2020. I built four dataframes from the daily edit-data in october (english anonymous, german anonymous, english user and german user).
Afterwards I plotted a bar graph for each dataframe.

#### Challenges
The most challenging thing to me was dealing with jupyter-notebook.

## R1 - Reflection
> Podcast: Human-centered Design in Data Science (with Peter Bull)


### üó®Ô∏è&nbsp; "How does the podcast inform your understanding of human centered data science?" 
The most important aspect to me was that data scientists should focus on the problem and not only on the method.
I think that this is often a problem for computer scientists, since the things we deal with in our university education are mainy focused on methods.
Another interesing aspect was the problem of bias and that data is often not objective or neutral.

### ‚ùì&nbsp; Questions 
What is meant by "empathy" as a necessary skill for data scientists?
Does ist just mean that data scientists have to be able to identify with the problems and projects they are working with? Or that we need a solid value system and always reflect the implications of our work?
