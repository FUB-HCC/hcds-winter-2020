## A1 - Warm up

* Experiance with seeting up the environment.  
*I do not have much experience with using git, so setting up the folder structure and figuring out the git workflow was a little challenging for me.* 

### Wikipedia Edits

* Briefly describe how you solved the last hand-on task.  
*At first, I chose a wikipedia entry, retrieved the data for users and anonymous in two different languages and then I merged all my dataframes into one. 
Afterwards, I created a plot to visualize it.*  
* Add an image of your plot here and describe what you can see. üñºÔ∏è   
*The plot shows the latest user vs. anonymous edits on the English and German version of the Wikipedia page about the Coronvirus.
Apparently, no recent edits have been made to the German version of the page.*

#### Challenges
* Describe what tasks were challenging to you.  
*I found it challenging to find a wikipedia article which is available in several languages and which has recent edits.
I tried several topics such as country names or societal issues but couldn't find a topic with recent edits in both, the German and English version. In the end I chose "Corona" as I thought this would lead to recent edits but I was suprised that there was no recent edits on the German page either.*. 
* What was surprising, what did you learn? üòÆ   
*I was suprised how easy and smooth you can retrieve wikipedia data.*

## R1 - Reflection
> Podcast: Human-centered Design in Data Science (with Peter Bull)


### üó®Ô∏è&nbsp; "How does the podcast inform your understanding of human centered data science?"  
*I loved the podcast. I have been listening to DataFrame since a few years and their podcasts really got me inspired about data science. 
In this particular episode I liked how Peter Bull emphasized the practical value of data science and how important it is to produce useful and user-centered outcomes. 
I fully agree on his approach that methods shouldn't come first but second. I also liked how they described in which way data science 
can really serve society and support human decision making and that data science shouldn't be a self-serving field.*  

### ‚ùì&nbsp; Questions 
1. How does the cookie cutter data science project work? Sounded really interesting to me.
1. Why is access to Data Science as a field still so hard for non-computer scientists if the data science community keeps highlighting that a "Human-Centered" approach is super important? Why isn't there more emphasize on training professionals from "Human-Centered" fields in data science methodology?
