## R3 - Reflection
> Article: Algorithmic Profiling of Job Seekers in Austria: How Austerity Politics Are Made Effective

### üó®Ô∏è&nbsp; "How does the video inform your understanding of human centered data science?"  
I found the article very interesting as it shows how important it is to think about the ethical consequences when implementing a technical system, especially if it is being designed for the public sector. It further illustrates that the quality of an algorithm does not just depend on its technical efficiency but also on its practical implication. The algorithm might classify cases very accurately and correctly but still not be designed for society's needs. 

### ‚ùì&nbsp; Questions
_Using full sentences, list at least one question that this video raised in your mind, and say why it caused you to ask this question_

1. Who developed the algorithm? Did the consist in comupter scientists only or was there people with other backgrounds involved?
1. I wondered why the algorithm did not include the job seekers needs but only their demographics? Wouldn't the classification  be more useful if it integrated the job seeker's personal struggles such as discrimination (if they belong to a minority group), health issues (in case of chronic illnesses)... ?

### Reflections and implications

Write about `350` words, reflecting on what you have learned, what you found, what (if anything) surprised üò≤ you about your findings, and/or what theories you have about why any biases might exist (if you find they exist). Please also include any questions this assignment raised for you about bias, Wikipedia, or machine learning.

_Your 350 words_

1. _Your question 1?_
1. _Your question 2?_

### Questions

Pleas answer the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences each.

1. What biases did you expect to find in the data (before you started working with it), and why?
    * _answer_
1. What (potential) sources of bias did you discover or introduce during data processing and analysis?
    * _answer_
1. What might your results suggest about (English) Wikipedia as a data source?
    * _answer_
1. What might your results suggest about the internet and global society in general?
    * _answer_
1. Can you think of a realistic data science research situation where using these data (to train a model, perform a hypothesis-driven research, or make business decisions) might create biased or misleading results, due to the inherent gaps and limitations of the data?
    * _answer_
1. Can you think of a realistic data science research situation where using these data (to train a model, perform a hypothesis-driven research, or make business decisions) might still be appropriate and useful, despite its inherent limitations and biases?
    * _answer_
1. How might a researcher supplement or transform this dataset to potentially correct for the limitations/biases you observed?
    * _answer_
