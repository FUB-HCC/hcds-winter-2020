### üó®Ô∏è&nbsp; "How does the podcast inform your understanding of human-centered data science?"  

This podcast hardened my dislike of podcasts, it felt like a puddle of fragmented thoughts, it seemd like the interviewer had to tick some boxes on his list. With all the interruptions, it was so hard to follow, so instead of real sentences, I can only write down points that made me **_not_** fall asleep.

When it got political, it finally turned into a conversation but that is also where I finally lost any interest.

- The world is stochastic. The world is deterministic.
- Free will is an illusion that we AI people will solve.
- Machine learning means: Conditional probability estimators.
- Easy: Find effect from cause. Difficult : Find cause from effect. First exercise: express it mathematically
- Either try a real experiment or rely on observation and study.
- Fake experiment with model - changes possibly to x withough risking other changes as in real-life
- Methapors are an expert system
- Looking at the facts won't give you strings behind the facts.
- Empathy, compassion: I have a model of myself, so i can map you to my model: If I am able to suffer, so are you.
- But "me" is conscience. A blueprint of who I am in my environment.
