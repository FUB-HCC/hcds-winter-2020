> **Podcast:** "Judea Pearl: Causal Reasoning, Counterfactuals, Bayesian Networks, and the Path to AGI" (Lex Fridman)

### üó®Ô∏è&nbsp; "How does the podcast inform your understanding of human-centered data science?"  
A lot of topics were discussed in rather philosophical way, which makes it hard to summarize the podcast. Judea Pearl is one of the pioneers of Bayesian networks and the probabilistic approach to artificial intelligence, so his knowledge about mathematics and ML is huge. 
He says it is important to ask yourself "What do you want to estimate" and formulate a research question and thus construct a model based on that question. We need to make assumptions based on observational studies. 
They are also talking about causation (or causal reasoning) which is a temporal relationship between a cause and its effect. Causal reasoning methods and insights are directly related to core machine learning challenges of robustness, generalizability, bias, and explainability. It is widely seen as a necessary precursor for building more human-like machine intelligence.

### ‚ùì&nbsp; Questions
1. How can we identify causal effects?

**Why:** As computing increasingly impact all parts of life, questions of cause-and-effect are critical for the design and data-driven evaluation of all the applications we build.
