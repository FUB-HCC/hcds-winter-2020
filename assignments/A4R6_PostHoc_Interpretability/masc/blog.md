### üó®Ô∏è&nbsp; "How does the podcast inform your understanding of human-centered data science?"  
The podcast covers a variety of topics, it covers the topic of intelligence and the distinction between "human intelligence" and "artificial intelligence" and that it is hard to define these terms in general and to draw a line between the two and to decide whether "fake intelligence" is still intelligence even though machines don't have conscousness which could be considered as the main aspect of intelligence. Futhermore, the podcast informs about research methods, experiments, the creation of models and how we can generate findings with machine learning models and that it is not always that easy and how difficult it is to do causal reasoning.

### ‚ùì&nbsp; Questions
1. What is intelligence? Should we call "artificial intelligence" intelligence or is it too different? How can we define the terms if not even the human sciences agree on one clear definition of "human intelligence"?

2. How to solve the problem of causal relation if we do not have enough data and can only conclude from correlations? Should we just accept it as it is and work with correlations or should we try to generate more experiments which allow causal relations? Or are correlations good enough in many cases?
