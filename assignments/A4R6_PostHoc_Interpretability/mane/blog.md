### üó®Ô∏è&nbsp; "How does the podcast inform your understanding of human-centered data science?"  
_Answer in at least 2-3 complete sentences_

The podcast informs about the importance of causality in the field of artificial intelligence. Humans intuitive understand causes and effects and can ifer from that whereas current machines are still far away from that. I also leraned that current ML is mostly fokussing on data but human intelligence can not only be derived from that.

### ‚ùì&nbsp; Questions

1. Is a Bayesian network a starting point for a machine with causal reasoning? Or isn't it just another data-centered approach?

**Why:** I would like to know more about examples of current algorithms that include a sort of causal reasoning.

2. If we can build a computer with causal reasoning, causal inference, etc. do we than really have human level inteligence?

**Why:** I am not sure if this is the final approach to human iteloligence.
