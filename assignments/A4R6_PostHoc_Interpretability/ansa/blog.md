### üó®Ô∏è&nbsp; "How does the podcast inform your understanding of human-centered data science?"  
_Answer in at least 2-3 complete sentences_

### ‚ùì&nbsp; Questions
1. Can you express every question mathematically?

**Why:** The interviewee got asked what is a good way to do a reasearch. He responded with we should state every question mathimatically first before trying to find an answer.
