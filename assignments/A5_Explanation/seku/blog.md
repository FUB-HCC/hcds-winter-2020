## A5 - Explanations

### Task 1: Different Explanation Needs

#### ORES Scenario

** Please describe the roles and the different explanation needs in the context of ORES by writing your own scenario. Tool to detect incomplete and unsufficiently proven articles

*Description:* Machine learning systems are being used in photo gallery applications inside of phones and computers to categorize photos. On use case is to enable extended photo search functionality, for example, the user can search for the keyword "car" and the app will return all gallery pictures containing objects that have been identified as a car. Additionally they are being used to detect persons in pictures to match them with a specific contact from the users contact list. In the latter case, the application already cathegorizes detected persons, but the user has to link the person collection to a specific contact. The user can also decide, wether a detected person matches with its assigned group or if the application has made a mismatch.

* Creators: the software company and its employees that developed the gallery app

* Operators: the users of the application

* Executors: the user of the application

* Decision-subject: the user of the application

* Data-subject: the user of the application and every person and object that has been photographed. Also all objects and people which have been photographed to train the ML System before releasing the app

* Examiners: mostly the quality assurance department of the software company, but also the user that decides wether a photo was cathegorized correctly

**Explanation needs**
* The creators need to explain the idea of the ML system to the developers, that implement the application
* Operators need to know, how to use the ML feature in the gallery application
* Data-subjects need to know how to cathegorize photos properly to make the best out of the application function
* Data-subjects should get an explanation how their data is being used
* Examiners need an explanation on the expected application behavior
