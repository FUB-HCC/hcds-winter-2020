## A5 - Explanations

### Task 1: Different Explanation Needs

#### ORES Scenario
Social science researchers may use the ORES model to discover and compare the online knowledge discourse sharing dynamics by assessing edit qualities of different topics on a specific wikimedia project. Take English Wikipedia for instance, the researchers may choose edits around different social debate topics such as "me too", "climate change", "covid 19" etc to discover how well is the knowledge base discussed on wikipedia. <br>
_Creators_: The Wikipedia group and the ML model designer. <br>
_Operator_: Researchers <br>
_Executors_: Researchers <br>
_Decision-Subjects_: Researchers <br>
_Data-Subjects_: selected articles on wikipedia <br>
_Examiners_: not sure if our scenarion contains examiners



#### Reflection

We think the role-based model should be considered throughout the human-centered design process. A data science project design using human-centered data science process should consider "human-in-the-loop"[1] element in the whole design process. As long as the users stand in the center of our design process, the concept of user-centric design has to be kept in mind. We then will specify why the users should be considered in different roles and examples are given on Image. 

**Analyse** : in analysis process, it is important to undertake requirements analysis to find out what features a system is supposed to have. It is about the expectations of the system from users. Since different roles have different expectations in the same use case, it is essential to use role-based model to find out what are expected from whom.

**Design for Usability**: In this stage, role-based model is important for interaction design. We may consider an explainable machine learning diagnostic system, doctors as operators as well as executors have different needs other than patients who are suffered from certain symptoms. 

**Evaluation**: Evaluation is important for testing the usage and usability. In machine learning system it is essential if the system will explain its results which "directly affect" users [GDPR, 2016]. Therefore, the user roles and evaluation of their perception of explanation should be considered in this stage.

**Feedback** : As mentioned in the first stage (analysis), different roles of users have different expectations on the system, in this case we should consider their feedback seperately and maybe have some tradeoffs for next iterative step.
