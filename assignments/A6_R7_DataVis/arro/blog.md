## R7 - Reflection
The paper proposes 18 generally applicable design guidelines for human AI interaction, which are roughly categorized into situations where they may occur during an interaction with the user. These guidelines can help engineer's to plan and build their AI to follow these principles to improve the user interaction by providing them with suggestions if something went wrong or how the system should learn from their users behavior.



Some of the guidelines should be easy to implement such as `G1`, `G2` and `G18` but others are way more complicated such as `G5` and `G6`. There I ask myself if the description ("G6: **Match relevant social norms.** Ensure the experience is delivered in a way that users would expect, given their social and cultural context.") falls a bit short and leaves room for interpretation on what someone expects.
