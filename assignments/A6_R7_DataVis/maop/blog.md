## R7 - Reflection
*Answer in at least 2-3 complete sentences the question "How does the reading inform your understanding of human-centered data science?".*

There are many barriers to human-AI interaction. A well-defined human design process can help to identify and solve these problems early on. In doing so, the problems that can arise in the development of human-AI systems should be less accepted as immutable. Rather, they should be investigated and justified in more detail so that sustainable solutions can be developed based on these challenges. The 18 guidelines can be used for this purpose.


*By reflecting on your sentences, list at least one question that occurred in your mind while reading, and explain your motivation for asking this question.*

The category of "when wrong" (G7-G11) seems particularly important to me. Therefore, I wonder if there is a prioritization in these guidelines, as I can imagine that not every one of these guidelines gets attention considering very short development times. A prioritization would help establish a ranking of importance in order to cover the most important aspects.
