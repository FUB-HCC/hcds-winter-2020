        "The COMPAS (\"*Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions*\") dataset is a tool used by judges and probation/parole officers to predict a criminals likelihood to re-offend. The dataset contains 14 features reaching from age, to fellony count, to race and gender. These categories are then again devided into numerical *(9)* and categorical *(5)* features. In addition information about the average, or most common values of a particular feature are included, as well as a few other related statistics (median, min, etc.). \n",

        "The Probublica analysis found a bias against African American people. White people with a similar or even more criminal background were often times predicted to be less likely to offend again. This was disputed by the analysis multiple times through, where criminal indiviuals were tracked for 2 years after their sentencing. Various examples show that many white individuals, who were considered a low risk, reoffended. This can also be seen in the table, where white individuals are much more likely to be labeled low risk, but actually reoffend, while when being labeled high risk, their chances of not offending again a substantially lower. Therefor both statistics show around a 20 % advantage for white indiviuals, which means black people are wrongly evaluated as being almost twice to reoffend.\n",
