## R7 - Reflection

The Human-AI Interaction Design Guidelines by Microsoft emphasized how important user-interaction and user-adaption with and from the AI system are.  The user should not only be informed about what the system does, how and why it produces certain outputs, but also be able to adjust the system and therefor improve future predictions. Latter can also work together with a self learning system, that adapts to the users behavior. 

**Question**

How much controll should a user get over adjusting the system, since it might also be overwhelming and take away from the user experience, when asked too often to validate a system produced prediction. (The AI system could feel very dependant on the users verfication, which might make the whole system feel obsolet)
