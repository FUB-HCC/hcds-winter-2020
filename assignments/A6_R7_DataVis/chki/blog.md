## R7 - Reflection
#### Please read page three of the paper Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction. I recommend reading the appendix of the paper and, if you have time, the full paper - this is optional.

_Answer in at least 2-3 complete sentences the question "How does the reading inform your understanding of human-centered data science?"._

Universal design guidelines should be complemented by more specific guidlines for the application/use case at hand. For example, specific guidelines are important for systems using AI as they may show unpredictable behaviour due to their nature. Using these guidelines, confusion could be prevented and better informed actions could be taken by the user. 

_List at least one question that occurred in your mind while reading, and explain your motivation for asking this question._

Guideline G5 says "Match relevant social norms". I stumbled across that guideline for a couple of reasons. It seemed pretty general and not strongly related to AI. A couple of questions arised: What social norms are important and how should they be taken into account (in my specific context)? Is there related work or a list to refer to? Does this lead into the direction of personalized user experiences (or at least different interfaces tailored to needs of certain user groups)
