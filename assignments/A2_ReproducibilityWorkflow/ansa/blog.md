## R2 - Reflection
> Book: The Practice of Reproducible Research (Chapter 2 and 3)

### Definitions
#### _Reproducibility and replicability_

**Reproducibility**
*[...] the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original investigator. That is, a second researcher might use the same raw data to build the same analysis files and implement the same statistical analysis in an attempt to yield the same results.*

**Replicability**
*[...] which refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study if the same procedures are followed but new data are collected.*


#### _How does this relate to the definitions given in the lecture?_

In my opinion we have the same definition of reproducibility. But the definition for replicability is slightly different. Our defined goal with replicating is not neccessarily to duplicate the results with new data but to either enhance, confirm or contradict the theory behind the research.

### 🗨️&nbsp; "How does the reading inform your understanding of human centered data science?"  
_Describe in at least 2-3 full sentences._

First of all I would understood that repeatability, reproducibility and replicability are important steps in any scientific research field. That's because any relevant theory of today is proven more than once. And if we start our Data Science studies with an interesting question (purposeful) then we have to make sure that other researchers can build up their studies from our research.

The second most important thing I learned was that all of these aspects are not binary. Meaning that if you always do a specific step then something is reproducible. We can always only increase the likelihood of repeatability, reproducibility and replicability. There are core principles like licensing and documentation which are crucial for every research and we should provide them in any project as good as possible.
### ❓&nbsp; Questions
_List at least 1 question (full sentence) that this reading raised in your mind, and say why._

1. Why is this important ?

It did not seem relevant for me in the first sight. But I figured out the answer for me which I explain in the blog above.

## A2 - Reproducibility Workflow
_Briefly describe your experience using the reproducibility workflow._

The workflow it self is pretty straightforward and is not hard to understand and work with. But to be honest it felt like a chore and sometimes I felt like skipping a 'small' step. So I had to remind myself that if I want to do relevant work that I must include these steps.

### Challenges
_Describe what tasks were challenging to you._

- Not skipping a certain step in the reproducibility workflow because it felt like a chore
- Documenting it and trying to guess if it is explained well enough

_What was surprising, what did you learn?_ 😮 

- I learned more about matplotlib and could enhance my graph from the previous assignment
- Why the reproducibility workflow is important
