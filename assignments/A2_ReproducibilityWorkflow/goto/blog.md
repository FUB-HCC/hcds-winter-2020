## R2 - Reflection
> Book: The Practice of Reproducible Research (Chapter 2 and 3)

### Definitions
Both sources, the book and the lecture, we close to each other in defiining **reproducability** and **replication**. In the book was mentioned that in other places, the definitions would need to be switched and then they'd be the same.
So **reproducability** grants anybody the opportunity to reproduce everything involved in the project and gain the same results. So it is sort of a proof that everything worked correctly and that anyone can proof the project's results. **replication** means that the project's workflow can be transferred to, say, different data.

### üó®Ô∏è&nbsp; "How does the reading inform your understanding of human centered data science?"  
Less than expected since this appeared to me like it was a part of another module I've visited ("Empirische Bewertungen in der Informatik") where the focus also was laid on above mentioned definitions. 

### ‚ùì&nbsp; Questions
I wonder wether the workflow on Jupyiter is suitable for larger projects. Is there a standarised procedure concerning this?

## A2 - Reproducibility Workflow
It felt like writing a tutorial which seems to be a good thing if I need to review things later: I wrote it myself, then there might be a high chance that past-me tells things future-me in a understandable manner :)

### Final Wikipedia Page View Plot
**TODO**

### Challenges
There are so many things to look up when using new libraries or a new framework, so it actually took a lot of time. Other than that, I tried plotting but despite code-snippets it did not work :(
