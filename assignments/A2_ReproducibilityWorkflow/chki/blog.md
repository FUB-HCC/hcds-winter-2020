## R2 - Reflection
> Book: The Practice of Reproducible Research (Chapter 2 and 3)

### Definitions
_Reproducibility and replicability_
The authors mention different (and even contradicting) definitions of reproducibility and replicability. The authors understand reproducibility as the ability to produce the same results as the original investigators using the methods and data they originally used. Replicability on the other hand is defined as the ability to duplicate results by using the same approach and methods but with different (and probably newly collected) data as a basis. 

The basic ideas and approaches given by the authors to reach reproducibility of final results also include reproducibility of intermediate results. 

_How does this relate to the definitions given in the lecture?_
The definitions given in the lecture rest upon the same main ideas. The definition of reproducibility additionally specifies key quantitative findings, tables and figures as part of the finals results. Furthermore it specifies that reproducing results should be possible only with a set of files and instructions in textual form. \
In the lecture, different degrees of replication were discussed and the definition mentioned that replication - of course - can also produce contradicting results.

Interestingly, ACM's definitions given in the book and in the lecture differ (e.g. Reproducibility¬†(Different team, same experimental setup) vs. Reproducibility (Different team, different experimental setup))

### üó®Ô∏è&nbsp; "How does the reading inform your understanding of human centered data science?"  
_Describe in at least 2-3 full sentences._
I think, reproducibility is important not only for human centered data science but science in general.
I learned, that conflicts may arise between replicability (revealing artifacts/data) and restrictions like ethical or legal concerns. Ethical concerns (like privacy) are a central part of human centered data science (see ethics check list).

### ‚ùì&nbsp; Questions
_List at least 1 question (full sentence) that this reading raised in your mind, and say why._

1. Is it important to provide the full history of a data science project or is just important to keep the versions that were used for a publication? \
I assume it's only important to have the versions that were used for publications. Of course, if one uses a version control system like GitHub, it should be easy to offer the full history. On the other hand, there could be reasons (as stated above) to keep parts of the history secret (or even software artifacts used for a publication).

## A2 - Reproducibility Workflow
_Briefly describe your experience using the reproducibility workflow._
The workflow worked quite well and was easy to adapt. I am used to document steps in Jupyter Notebooks with Markdown and also to save intermediate results.
Accuratly following the work flow and best practices still took quite a lot of time. Especially because I usually do not write such an extensive README.

### Final Wikipedia Page View Plot

### Challenges
_Describe what tasks were challenging to you._
It was quite tedious to get the y-axis labels formatted correctly :). Apart from that the tasks were not that challanging but sometimes quite time consuming since I had to look up quite a few things. Apparently, I got a bit rusty but it was a good excercise to refresh my knowledge.

_What was surprising, what did you learn?_ üòÆ
