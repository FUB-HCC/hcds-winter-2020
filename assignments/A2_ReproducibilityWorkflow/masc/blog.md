## R2 - Reflection
> Book: The Practice of Reproducible Research (Chapter 2 and 3)

### Definitions
_Reproducibility and replicability_. 
  
*Reproducibility* is given if research results can be reproduced which means that the results of a study can be reproduced when a different researcher analyses the same dataset using the same methodology.  

*Replicability* refers to the act of conducting the same study at a different time with a new sample, so by collecting new data.

_How does this relate to the definitions given in the lecture?_

In the lecture, different examples from the practice were given and illustrated.  
The lecture gave a different definition of replicability. The lecture emphasized the idea of doing research critically and did not specify that in order to replicate you necessarily need to collect new data.  

### üó®Ô∏è&nbsp; "How does the reading inform your understanding of human centered data science?"  
Reproducibility and replicability are very important aspects of research. Unfortunately, both are not done enough in the current research community. However, in order to tackle bias in scientific research, it would be important to make all research reproducible. I see a huge potential in Human-Centered-Data Science to solve this problem. The social sciences often lack the resources to make their datasets and codes available to the research community as the use of R or python scripts for analysis is not common practice (yet).

### ‚ùì&nbsp; Questions
_List at least 1 question (full sentence) that this reading raised in your mind, and say why._

1. How can data scientists wich a focus on Human-Centered Data Science helpt to make social science research better?
1. Why do scientific journals not encourage the researchers more to give access to their datasets?

## A2 - Reproducibility Workflow
I liked the assignment but I underestimated how time consuming it would be. I mainly struggled with finding the codes for merging my datasets and I failed to combine all traffic sources.

### Challenges
Joining all datasets and recoding the values was the most challenging part for me.
