The goal of the project is to analyse the usage of wikipedia from different device types over time. 

The API's that were used are the Legacy Pagecounts and the newer Pageviews API.

Pagecounts: https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Legacy_Pagecounts
Pageviews: https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Pageviews


The Legacy Pagecount API is the old wikipedia analysis API, which was than replaced by the Pageviews API. There is however a overlapping period of a few months. Also the older version does not include the access type "mobile app", while the newer version does distinguish between "mobile-app" and "mobile-web". Also the Pageviews API excludes data collected from crawlers while Pagecounts takes into consideration all accesses, which explaines the small difference during the overlapping period.

Values: 

Month/Year - specifies the time of access
Pagecounts - specifies the counted accesses by the older API 
Pageviews - specifies the counted accesses by the newer API
