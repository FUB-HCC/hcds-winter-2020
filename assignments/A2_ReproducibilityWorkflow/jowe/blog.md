## R2 - Reflection
> Book: The Practice of Reproducible Research (Chapter 2 and 3)

### Definitions
_Reproducibility and replicability_

The authors list multiple definitions of the terms, they prefer the definition of Goodman, Fanelli & Ioannidis (2016):
* **Reproducibility:** "the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original investigator. That is, a second researcher might use the same raw data to build the same analysis files and implement the same statistical analysis in an attempt to yield the same results."

* **Replicability:** "which refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study if the same procedures are followed but new data are collected."  
_How does this relate to the definitions given in the lecture?_
Their prefered definition matches the one used in the lecture.

### üó®Ô∏è&nbsp; "How does the reading inform your understanding of human centered data science?"
Creating research which can be validated by external sources is one of the key points of scientific work. To create reproducible research it is important to include this way of thinking into every part of the research workflow. Reproducibility isn't something to implement once the research is completed, it needs to be thought of and worked on at every step of the workflow. Producing reproducible research not only benefits the scientific community in which the research is conducted by being able to fully validate the findings, it also benefits the researcher by making his or her research easier to debug and understand.
_Describe in at least 2-3 full sentences._

### ‚ùì&nbsp; Questions
_List at least 1 question (full sentence) that this reading raised in your mind, and say why._

1. How does the need for reproduciblity differ when comparing academic research to in-company research or other fields? I imagine the possibilities to create completely reproducible research when researching user retention rates in a company for example are significantly smaller when compared to academic research, due to strict deadlines, the need for up-to-date data and limited budget. At the same time there may not be a need for the same degree of reproducibility compared to academic research. If the degree to which you can implement reproducibility differs depending on the context, which "parts" of the reproducible workflow are best/ok to cut first?

## A2 - Reproducibility Workflow
While some steps like saving the data in specific files seemed a bit cumbersome at times, the reproducible workflow led to a very structured way of working and made it very easy to find errors as well as understand the code at a later time.

### Challenges
_Describe what tasks were challenging to you._

While I had to look up a lot of specific snippets because of no previous Pandas experience, actually deciding on my own how to manipulate the data at which point was probably the most challenging point. The reproducible workflow helped me quite a bit there though, since it worked well to do one thing at a time and descripe it in text, which helped my own understanding as well.
_What was surprising, what did you learn?_ üòÆ 

That there are immediate benefits in using the reproducible workflow for myself, even when ignoring the positive impact it will have when sharing the result with other people. Also that it's not that hard to implement the reproducible workflow and the time is well worth it.
