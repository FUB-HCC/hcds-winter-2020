## Preparation

_**Susanne Michl** is a Professor of Medical Humanities and Medical Ethics at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin since 2017._<sup>1</sup> The professorship of "medical ethics" is an interdisciplinary field that deals with questions of morality and ethics that surrounds the work of doctors and physicians. The brown university puts it like this: _Science and technology provide us with the means to diagnose and treat the sick and injured, but they don't address the big, human questions that arise when patients face suffering and death or prepare us to examine our values, frailties, and capacity for compassion and tolerance._<sup>2</sup>
Michl's concerns include decisions concerning patients, the process on making these decisions and the underlying data.

- ##### Would it be good to have obligatory courses about ethics for any ongoing doctor? (In my experience, everyone claims to already have a moral compass. Being lectured about something that can be seen as an opinion (like "what is _good_"?) can either be eye-opening - or the opposite.)
- ##### I wonder if any human centered field will ever grow to be more than "nice to have": How could politics get involved in a way that e.g. there are consequences (as it is punishable to quit employees due to race, yet COMPAS had to fear no consequences) or that it is mandatory to include an expert in ethics when creating a system like this? (I mean, I wonder how to make clear accusations, policies, etc.)


## Summary
Michl's lecture focussed on AI being used for medical purposes. She started by first showing the development of discussions about the subject in the last decades, as the second part she then pointed at the actors involved and finished in the third part with examples, like "Aspire Health", a tool to predict the time a patient may remain alive.

The discussion about ethics concerning the advance of technologies used in health care is not new and started already in the last sixties, however the exponential rise of the capabilities of IT seems not to be taken into account accordingly. Michl pointed out that the aspect of human influence on computer-aided systems is to be not underestimated, as any tiny screw (so to say) is initially adjusted by one or some humans and prone to coincidences. Though AI is of great help, today it seems futuristic to think of it to be more than that.

## Mind Map

## Question
I am curious about her standpoint or prediction about my question above: How can ethics become a part of IT (_in a way like politics try to establish laws to abolish injustice due to racism and sexism_), if that is possible, and what are the first side effects that come to your mind?

## Takeways
Mostly I am surprised that there actually is a chair about "Medical Humanities and Ethics" and even "Medical Education" or "LGBTQ Healthcare and Advocacy".
