## Preparation

_Susanne Michl is a Professor of Medical Humanities and Medical Ethics at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin since 2017. Her research focuses on clinical ethics, narrative medicine and medical humanities, as well as individual/personalized medicine. 

1. From the guest lecture, we can see that there are so many existing ethical frameworks for data science practices, but ethical challenges still seem untackled. Are there any data science practices follow any of the mentioned framework? If yes, to what extent can the ethical issues be clarified by using these frameworks? If not, What was the reason behind? It there any new challenge or the ethical guidelines/frameworks are not applicable?
1. I don't really understand the example of recidivism. In the paper it is talked that: "intuitive sense of fairness might imply: that a risk score is equally accurate in predicting the likelihood of recidivism for members of different racial groups; that members of different groups have the same chance of being wrongly predicted to recidivate; or that failure to predict recidivism happens at the same rate across groups". The paper said that the "each of these expectations of a fair score might seem like complementary requirements, recent work has established that satisfying all three at the same time would be impossible in most situations". I don't really understand why the three expectations are complementary? [Page 25, in Section: Where Ethics Is Not Enough]
1. Based on last question, is there always an unable triangle for fairmess complementary requirements in each project (or most projects) in data science practices? 
1. How to understand the "paradoxical positions" of the critics writing on data science [Page 25, in Section: Toward a Constructive Collaboration]


## Summary
_approximately 250 words_

The presentation of Prof. Dr. Susanne Michl is about ethical issues surrouding human medicine. Prof. Dr. Susanne Michl structured her presentation into three sections using the metaphors from a play structur: (i) setting the stage: introduction of theoretical background of ethics (in particular bioethics); (ii) clear stage for actors: introduction of actors and their interactive relationship in the ethical context; (iii) start the play: ethical aspects and its influence on current medical/clinica practices from differenct perspectives.

_First section_ introduces the historical and theoretical background of ethics (especially bioethics). She explained that most of these policies are based on principles but problems will come out when the ethical issue goes to two conflicting priciples for example as "no-damage" and "participation". Therefore, in order to bring the principles into practices, ethical justification is NOT needed for the individual principles and the duties derived from them, but for the weighting of the principles. We therefore need flexible, reflexive approaches and tools that take these considerations into account at a very early stage in technology development and design.

_Second section_ considers human and machines as two leading roles in a human-machine system. Prof.Dr.Susanne Michl described the interactions of human autonomy, machine automation, autonomous machine systems and  automated human actions in a reversible system of human machine symbios. We have to rethink the relationship and the relationship context of a two way model respectively regarding allocation as well as supportance. She then presented two ways of rethinking the human-machine interactions, respectively from micro- and macro views. The project DIAMED for structured reporting and diagnostic support in radiology is an example for rethinking a technical solution as a social-technical solution from a micro perspective (zoom-in), whereas rethinking the development and use of digital technologies in the area of tension between responsibility and trust deals with a macro perspective (zoom-out). 

In the _third section_, Prof. Dr. Susanne Michl also provides two views to consider the ethical impacts on knowledge generation and on decision-making. Based on the two points of view, Prof. Dr. Susanne Michl shows that how human-AI system will change our understanding of roles in traditional models and how the human-AI symbios will trigger new difficulties in clinical decision processes.

## Question
1. Ethical issues are really a complex topic, since it is combines with social values, and sometimes even combined with political issues. But we are kind of aware that someone the scientific research sacrifices ethical values. To what extent is the sacrifice allowed? For example for medical research or medical experiences, is there any compromised solution between data science practices and ethical issues suah as experiments on "little white mice" in medicine research? 

1. As reflected in the COVID-19, different governments have different measurements based on their political/ethical values. Conflicting values may make the coorporation across countries difficult. In clinical AI system, do you think the conflicting ethical value assessments will hinder the future international medical cooperation?

## Takeways
I think the second section is most useful for me since I learned how to consider the roles of human and machines as well as their relationships in a human-AI symbios. Before this lecture, I wasn't really aware of the reflective relationship between the four factors in a human-AI autonomous system, and I kind of don't know what machine automation and autonomous machine systems really mean in an automating system. In my practice, I will consider human and machines as two equally interacting roles than simply still imagine machines as dead systems only taking inputs from humans. 

My second takeway is that it is always important to consider its social impact at an early stage of system design (first section). For the requirement analysis, we need to consult the aspects from ethical practioners and clarify our ethical impacts as well as be aware of  the tensions between conflicting ethical principles of our system. We need to be always be careful of making any tradeoff in system design and be aware of system limitations.
