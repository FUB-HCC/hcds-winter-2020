## Preparation

_Susanne Michl is a Professor of Medical Humanities and Medical Ethics at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin since 2017. Her research focuses on clinical ethics, narrative medicine and medical humanities, as well as individual/personalized medicine. 

1. From the guest lecture, we can see that there are so many existing ethical frameworks for data science practices, but ethical challenges still seem untackled. What was the reason behind? It there any new challenge or the ethical guidelines/frameworks are not applicable?
1. Ethical issues are really a complex topic, since it is combines with social values, and sometimes even combined with political issues. But we are kind of aware that someone the scientific research sacrifices ethical values. To what extent is the sacrifice allowed? For example for medical research or medical experiences, is there any compromised solution between data science practices and ethical issues suah as experiments on "little white mice" in medicine research?
1. I don't really understand the example of recidivism. In the paper it is talked that: "intuitive sense of fairness might imply: that a risk score is equally accurate in predicting the likelihood of recidivism for members of different racial groups; that members of different groups have the same chance of being wrongly predicted to recidivate; or that failure to predict recidivism happens at the same rate across groups". The paper said that the "each of these expectations of a fair score might seem like complementary requirements, recent work has established that satisfying all three at the same time would be impossible in most situations". I don't really understand why the three expectations are complementary? [Page 25, in Section: Where Ethics Is Not Enough]
1. Based on last question, is there always an unable triangle for fairmess complementary requirements in each project (or most projects) in data science practices? 
1. How to understand the "paradoxical positions" of the critics writing on data science [Page 25, in Section: Toward a Constructive Collaboration]
