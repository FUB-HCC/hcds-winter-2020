## Preparation


Franziska Boenisch is a computer scientist who has been working at Fraunhofer AISEC. The Fraunhofer AISEC is a research institute that is specialised in the area of application-oriented security. In her research and her ongoing PhD, Franziska Boenisch focussed on the protection of privacy, data and intelectual property in the field of ML.


1. Are there already any examples of security and privacy policies or a security framework in the context of ML? I am asking becasue I am siply courious if there are already some practical approaches.  
1. Is it realistic that there will be domain-agnostic formalisms for such policies? At the moment I can not think of an ML system charactaristic that would need specialized policies, but I wonder if there could be any.
