### 🗨️&nbsp; "How does the reading inform your understanding of human-centered data science?"  
_Answer in at least 2-3 complete sentences_
Interpretability of a model can either be intrinsic (due to the simplicity of the model) or achieved post-hoc by applying certain methods.
There are model-specific methods/tools for model interpretation and model-agnostic tools. The former (usually based on the model's internals) are - as the name implies - specific to a model. The latter can theoretically be used on any machine learning model. They usually use the model's input-output-pairs and are applied post-hoc.

### ❓&nbsp; Questions
1. Can post-hoc methods ever achieve the degree of interpretability/transparency that intrinsic models offer?
1. With regard to the last question: I think that the necessary degree of interpretability depends on the use case. There might be cases in which simplistic models are too weak for modeling complex situations. So at some point, I assume, we are dependent on methods for interpretability. How do we assure high interpretability for complex models in sensitive application scenarios? Can these methods create enough transparency and trust?
