    "SUGGESTION: ORES is web service, based on machine learning, which was created to help assess the quality of wikipedia articles. The ORES model predicts two parameter: “edit quality” and “article quality”. For predicting Article quality, ORES offers basic and advanced support. The goodfaith model is part of the advanced support. It identifies whether an article was saved in goodfaith.\n",

    "SUGGESTION: The model is useful for distinguishing between edits which are truly damaging and edits which seem to have been saved in goodfaith. It was trained on human judgement to separate edits that are done by spammers or vandals from those who are inexperienced or first time contributors.\n",
    "With this, every `good-faith` newcomer can then be directed to an appropriate mentoring place.\n",
