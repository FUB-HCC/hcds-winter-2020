## A1 - Warm up

Setting up the environment was kind of an up and down. At first, I wanted to set everythin up on a Windows Machine. This didn't work as planned due to a bunch of 
missing dependencies - just to make poetry run. After I managed to do that, the "poetry install" command couldn't finish due to some inconsistencies with python
on Windows so I decided to repeat this whole process on a Linux machine.

Due to the fact that I'm somewhat limited with my hardware, I decided to setup a virtual machine with Ubuntu. After the OS installation I started a terminal, installed
all poetry dependencies and voilá. Everything was running just as described in the instructions.

I guess setting everything up on a Windows Machine is possible, but working with a Unix system turns out to be (once again) a lot easier.

### Wikipedia Edits

Currently I'm stuck at plotting the wanted data
* Add an image of your plot here and describe what you can see. 🖼️ 

#### Challenges
The last task was most challanging, because I wasn't sure how to access the 'date' of the 'data' field to convert the dates.
* What was surprising, what did you learn? 😮
