## A1 - Warm up

* Experiance with seeting up the environment.
I do not have much experience with using git, so setting up the folder structure was a little challenging for me. 

### Wikipedia Edits

* Briefly describe how you solved the last hand-on task.
At first, I chose a wikipedia entry, retrieved the data for users and anonymous in two different languages and then I merged all my dataframes into one. Afterwards, I created a plot to visualize it.
* Add an image of your plot here and describe what you can see. üñºÔ∏è 


#### Challenges
* Describe what tasks were challenging to you.
I found it challenging to find a wikipedia article which is available in several languages and which has recent edits. I only found articles which had edits in the English version but none in the German version.
* What was surprising, what did you learn? üòÆ 
I was suprised how easy and smooth you can retrieve wikipedia data.

## R1 - Reflection
> Podcast: Human-centered Design in Data Science (with Peter Bull)


### üó®Ô∏è&nbsp; "How does the podcast inform your understanding of human centered data science?"  
I loved the podcast. I have been listening to DataFrame since a few years and their podcasts really got me inspired about data science. In this particular episode I liked how Peter Bull emphasized the practical value of data science and how important it is to produce useful and user-centered outcomes. I fully agree on his approach that methods shouldn't come first but second. I also liked how they described in which way data science can really serve society and support human decision making and that data science shouldn't be a self-serving field.
