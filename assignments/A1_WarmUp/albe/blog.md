## A1 - Warm up

As I already took part in some courses where we used Python and Jupyter Notebook luckily my
environment was already ready for starting with the assignment. 


### Wikipedia Edits

The last hands-on assignment was pretty easy for me to implement as most of the required code was 
given inthe previews task. I just had to wrap it into a method and run it for a wiki page in two 
different languages. 

For the visualization part I first plotted the data with the matplotlib library what worked well but 
looked not so nice. Therefore tried it out with the altair which is a declarative visualization library 
for Python, based on Vega-Lite I learned in the Data Visualization course. 

With altair it was pretty easy to implement a nice looking visualization with some iteractive 
elements like a tooltip showing the date and the amount of edits when hovering over one of the cuves
and the possiblity of zooming in.

#### Challenges
* Chllenging for me was to understand the task with the following description "✏️ _Which columns interest you? Replace RR and Entity with other column labels_" and I am not sure if my solution is correct. 
I understood it is asked to replace the column names "RR" which had been renamed to "leisure" at that time and the column "Entity" to some other name. 

* More interesting then suprising for me was to try out the BeautifulSoup library. I used it for the first
time. It seems to be powerfull for extracting informations from web pages.
