## A1 - Warm up

As I already took part in some courses where we used Python and Jupyter Notebook luckily my
environment was already ready for starting with the assignment. 


### Wikipedia Edits

The last hands-on assignment was pretty easy for me to implement as most of the required code was 

given in the previews task. I just had to wrap it into a method and run it for a wiki page in two 

different languages. 



For the visualization part I first plotted the data with the matplotlib library what worked well but 

looked not so nice. Therefore tried it out with the altair which is a declarative visualization library 

for Python, based on Vega-Lite I learned in the Data Visualization course. 



With altair it was pretty easy to implement a nice looking visualization with some interactive 

elements like a tooltip showing the date and the amount of edits when hovering over one of the curvesand the possibility of zooming in.

#### Challenges
* Challenging for me was to understand the following task "‚úèÔ∏è _Which columns interest you? Replace RR and Entity with other column labels_" and I am not sure if my solution is correct. 

I understood it is asking to replace the column names "RR"  which was already renamed to a few cell before  "leisure"  and the column "Entity" to some other name. 


* Interesting for me was to try out the BeautifulSoup library. I used it for the first

time. It seems to be amazing library for extracting information from web pages. 

 

## R1 - Reflection
> Podcast: Human-centered Design in Data Science (with Peter Bull)


### üó®Ô∏è&nbsp; "How does the podcast inform your understanding of human centered data science?"  

From what I captured about Human centered Data Science from the explanation of Peter Bull in the podcast

is that it is providing a standardized approach of designing and working on data science projects.

He is explaining 3 aspects: An engineering best practices for data science projects. Like the MVC design

pattern is giving web development projects a recognizable structure he recommends this also for data science projects. Having an ethics checklist. He is recommending to have an ethics checklist which should have a 

check mark for each step of a data science project. In regards of empathy he says that data scientists should 

empathise themself on how the data science solution will be used, they should understand get a good 

understanding of what problem needs to be solved ind which specific context. 

So for me this sounds like exactly like the first step of the human centered design process where empathizing

with the  problem and the context is the goal. 


### ‚ùì&nbsp; Questions 
The _Cookiecutter Data Science project_, Peter Bull introduces in the podcast seems to be from my understanding

something like a framework which provides a structure for a data science project. I wonder how much companies

make use of such frameworks and if also commercial companies make use of it?
